            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Katsiaryna Volkava, a Lead Software Quality Assurance Engineer with over 7 years of experience in ensuring quality across various projects and domains.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that quality is the cornerstone of modern software development. Achieving true quality involves a comprehensive set of techniques and practices, which together define an effective Quality Assurance Engineer.</p>
            <p>While I have extensive experience in manual testing, automation, and performance analysis, I don't confine myself to just one of these areas. To me, quality is a unified concept rather than a collection of separate disciplines. My role is to provide thorough analysis and testing of systems, ensuring quality from every angle and perspective. Quality is paramount—that’s why I focus on the quality of both tests and test code, and believe that well-written tests are the foundation of effective QA.</p>
            <p>Over the past 7 years, I’ve tested applications across a variety of domains, including SaaS, ERP, CRM, E-commerce, Data Management, and Entertainment. You can find more information about my projects and experience on the "Projects" page of my portfolio.</p>
            <p>Recently, I’ve been exploring interests in generative AI for testing and scalable cloud systems testing.</p>
